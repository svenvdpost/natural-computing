# Natural Selection in Boid Hunter-Prey Simulations

Welcome! This repository contains the source code for running a hunter-prey boid simulation, combined with a genetic algorithm.

## Running the code
The code can be run by simply running the Simulation.py file. In this file there are several parameters, these parameters can be changed to obtain different simulation results. For a sample run, you don't need to change the variables in the code, you can just run Simulation.py.

## Results
When running the code, resulting graphs and csv files of the trait evolution will be written to the folder Results/
